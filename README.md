# Node JS, ReactJS/Redux Real TIme Drone Monitor Technical Task Solution By Sergiy Koyev
Created Node JS/ReactJS/Redux Application which contains dashboard page: 

A company has a number of drones flying around the country. This system allows to track the location of every drone in real-time. The system's dashboard only display the last location of the drones, so the backend doesn't need to worry about the history. You can store the state of the application in-memory for simplicity reasons.

Each drone is associated with a unique identifier, and should report its geo-location coordinates to the central server in real-time through a cellular modem connection

The dashboard displaying the list of active drones, by their unique identifiers, along with their current speed. It visually highlight the drones that have not been moving for more than 10 seconds
